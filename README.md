my views:
- open source is nice. you should use it more often
- proprietary software is ok too. but. open source should be used more often!!

i like coding stuff for fun and making it open. i am also interested in graphical user interfaces and how they work. making things user friendly is something i want to learn.

contact for work: (i'm always available for jobs relating to either user interface or programming needs)
